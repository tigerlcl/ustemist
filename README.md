The [U-STEMist Scheme](https://www.ustemist.info/about) is under a UGC-funded joint-university teaching and learning research project in Hong Kong ,titled "Joint university collaboration to develop studentsâ€™ competence and leadership in promoting integrated STEM education".

It engages STEM majors (e.g. engineering, science and computer majors) and pre-service/in-service STEM subject teachers in STEM activities, facilitate exchange of expertise, team building and synergy generation among STEM majors from different faculties and universities to further enhance their STEM competence.

These are descriptions of documents below:
Final Poster - the same board as we presented on project presentation day

Codes folder: (Name + file type+ usage)
1. ImageClassification.py, python script, used to demo, interact with AI model and hardware
2. model_training.ipynb, Jupyter Notebook file, to train and test AI model for image classification.
3. my_model.h5, hdf5 file - a special format for AI model, to store all the configurations about the whole model and framework
Remark: my model.h5 is generated and saved by running model_training.ipynb afterwards.

Demo folder:
contains pictures and videos that we test our model

Hsapi folder:
Core API to interact with the AI board - [HornedSungem](http://www.hornedsungem.org/)

About Image Dataset:
They were kept on our project drive, which organised by The Education University of Hong Kong. So we may not able to share them directly in documents.
